## Update to Local USDZ support (12.12.25)
Local directory support was recently dropped in one of the larger refactorings. This has been
restored with a slightly different interface. Now, for users to run Alpasim with local USDZ files,
they can use the `scenes.local_usdz_dir` configuration parameter. For example:
``` bash
# to run all scenes in the local_usdz_dir directory:
alpasim_wizard +deploy=local wizard.log_dir=<output_dir> scenes.local_usdz_dir=<abs or rel path to directory> scenes.test_suite_id=local
# to run a subset  of the scenes:
alpasim_wizard +deploy=local wizard.log_dir=<output_dir> scenes.local_usdz_dir=<abs or rel path to directory> scenes.scene_ids=[<your scene ids>]
```
