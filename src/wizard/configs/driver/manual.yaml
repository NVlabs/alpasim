# Manual Driver Configuration for Alpasim
# This driver returns a constant forward trajectory and is designed for
# human-in-the-loop control. It does not require a GPU.

# Logging level (uses wizard's global setting)
log_level: ${wizard.log_level}

# Model configuration
model:
  model_type: MANUAL
  # Manual model doesn't need checkpoints, but schema requires a path
  checkpoint_path: "unused"
  # Manual model is CPU-only, no GPU needed
  device: "cpu"

# Server configuration
host: "0.0.0.0"
port: ???

# Inference configuration
inference:
  use_cameras: ["camera_front_wide_120fov"]  # Display front camera to user
  max_batch_size: 1  # Human can only process one frame at a time
  subsample_factor: 1
  context_length: 1  # Only need latest frame

# Route configuration (manual driver ignores commands - human decides)
route:
  default_command: 2  # straight
  use_waypoint_commands: false  # Human makes decisions, not route

# Output configuration
output_dir: "/mnt/output/driver"

# No trajectory optimization needed for manual control
