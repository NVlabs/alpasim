# Eval-in-Runtime Configuration
# ==============================
# This config enables in-runtime evaluation, where metrics are computed
# directly in the runtime after each rollout completes, instead of running
# separate eval containers afterwards.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m alpasim_wizard +eval=eval_in_runtime ...

# Disable separate eval and aggregation services
# Runtime will handle evaluation and aggregation directly
wizard:
  run_eval_services: []
  run_aggregation_services: []

# Enable in-runtime evaluation (this is the default)
eval:
  run_in_runtime: true
